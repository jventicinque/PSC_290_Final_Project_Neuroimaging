#First, we need to make a mask of the whole brain and determine the number of voxels in data (this will be count as the "number of tests" that are being run).
#Make a mask of only voxels in the brain

mask_img = compute_epi_mask(unthresh_data)

#Determine the shape of the mask to see how many "independent tests" are being run

#Bonferonni Correction
#Is this test too conservative for neuroimaging data?
#bonferonni = alpha/ number of voxels 

def bonferroni_thresh(alpha = .05, n):
  return alpha / n

print(bonferroni_thresh(.05, n))

#plot to demonstrate bonferonni 
##example from online- grid width needs to be number of voxels.
grid_width = 100
threshold = 0.05/(grid_width**2)
simulation = SimulateGrid(grid_width=grid_width, n_subjects=20)
simulation.plot_grid_simulation(threshold=threshold, threshold_type='p', n_simulations=100)


#Family Wise Error Rate
#Is each test independent? Likely not, as there is some degree of spatial correlation

#False Discovery Rate
#The FDR is the expected proportion of false positives among significant tests.
